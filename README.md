# Case Study: Business Performance Analysis of ElectroHub

## Project Overview
As a data analyst at **ElectroHub**, a company originally focused on electronics and recently expanded into daily essentials, I investigated how this diversification affected overall business performance, profitability, and strategic direction.

## 1. Data Model & Approach
- Developed a robust **star schema model** to seamlessly join product, customer, promotion, and transaction data.  
- Enabled **advanced analytics** on sales, profit, and product-level performance.  

**Data Sources / Tools Used:**  
- Power BI (dashboard creation and visualization)  
- [Optional: SQL / Excel / CSV if applicable]  

---

## 2. Product Performance Overview
- **Top performers:** Electronics products (Apple iPhone, MacBook Air, Sony TV, Samsung S21) lead in sales, quantity, and profit.  
- **Bottom performers:** Non-tech items (Lunch box, Shampoo, Lotion, Toothpaste) are lagging, indicating the new categories haven’t reached the success of the tech segment yet.

## 3. Trends and City Insights
- **Profitability:** High correlation of profits with sales — high-profit items remain electronics.  
- **Sales by City:** Metro cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore) dominate, signaling key markets.  
- **Promotion Impact:** “Weekend Flash” and “Clearance” campaigns drive bigger discounts.  
- **Sales Trend:** Fluctuating but peaks align with new launches/promotions; recent declines linked to underperformance of non-tech expansion.  
- **Order Volume:** Over 3,500 orders captured; stable demand indicates a loyal customer base.

## 4. Strategic Insights & Recommendations
- Expansion into new categories has **not matched** core electronics in performance; non-tech items consistently lag.  
- Recommend **targeted marketing, research, and promotional investments** for non-tech categories.  
- Continue leveraging **electronics as flagship products** to drive store traffic and sales while piloting strategies for other categories.  
- **Monitor city-wise performance** to identify underpenetrated high-potential markets.

## 5. Outcome for Senior Management
This analysis equips management with a clear snapshot of:  
- Where the company **excels** (electronics).  
- Where **improvement or new strategy** is needed (non-tech products).  

The project demonstrates **end-to-end analytics skills**, including:  
- Data modeling  
- Interactive dashboards  
- Actionable business recommendations
